Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin.
Scheduling algorithm 0 simply iterates through our array of processes,
scheduling the next in turn.  If a processes doesn't finish, i.e. a clock
interrupt happened before completion, it is not allowed to finish; the next
process is always given control after the previous yields it.

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:
Scheduling Algorithm 1: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 ... | 3 | 4 |
Scheduling Algorithm 2: | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 ... | 4 | 4 |


Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1278.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 640ms.

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 958.5ms.
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480ms.


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
Exercise 4A

Exercise 5:
In my picture, the first known timer interrupt occurs duing the second round of
processes. In my picture, the first roung occurs as normal, but the second is
missing a '4'; since each process merely prints a character before yielding
control, this would implr the timer interupt occured during process 4's
execution.
