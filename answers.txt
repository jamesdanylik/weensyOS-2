Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin.
Scheduling algorithm 0 simply iterates through our array of processes,
scheduling the next in turn.  If a processes doesn't finish, i.e. a clock
interrupt happened before completion, it is not allowed to finish; the next
process is always given control after the previous yields it.

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)
